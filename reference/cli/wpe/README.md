# The WP Engine Headless CLI Commands

This section contains reference information on using WP Engine's command line
client. Each command has a reference page along with samples.

**NOTE:** With version 0.1.4 released March 18, 2021, Atlas CLI no longer requires the `alpha` syntax (such as `wpe alpha apps`). If you are still using a previous version of Atlas CLI, run `npm i @wpengine/headless-cli -g` to use commands without `alpha`.
